# Statistical Datasets for Minitab

## Overview
This repository contains **10 statistical models** designed for statistical analysis in **Minitab**. These  cover a variety of statistical concepts, including **descriptive statistics**, **hypothesis testing**, **regression**, **ANOVA**, **quality control**, and more. Each dataset is provided in **CSV format** for easy import into Minitab or other statistical software.

## Datasets

### 1. Descriptive Statistics Dataset
- **Description:** Sales data for a retail store over 12 months.
- **Columns:** Month, Sales (in $), Customers, Advertising Spend (in $).
- **Use Case:** Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and create histograms.

### 2. Hypothesis Testing Dataset
- **Description:** Performance data for two machines in a manufacturing plant.
- **Columns:** Machine A (Production Output), Machine B (Production Output).
- **Use Case:** Perform a two-sample t-test to compare the means of the two machines.

### 3. Regression Analysis Dataset
- **Description:** Relationship between advertising spend and sales revenue.
- **Columns:** Advertising Spend (in $), Sales Revenue (in $).
- **Use Case:** Perform simple linear regression to predict sales revenue based on advertising spend.

### 4. ANOVA Dataset
- **Description:** Effectiveness of three fertilizers on crop yield.
- **Columns:** Fertilizer Type (A, B, C), Crop Yield (in kg).
- **Use Case:** Perform one-way ANOVA to test for significant differences in crop yield.

### 5. Quality Control Dataset
- **Description:** Measurements of product dimensions from a manufacturing process.
- **Columns:** Sample ID, Dimension (in mm).
- **Use Case:** Create control charts (e.g., X-bar and R charts) to monitor process stability.

### 6. Correlation Dataset
- **Description:** Relationship between hours studied and exam scores.
- **Columns:** Hours Studied, Exam Score (out of 100).
- **Use Case:** Calculate the correlation coefficient and create a scatterplot.

### 7. Chi-Square Test Dataset
- **Description:** Distribution of customer preferences for three product variants.
- **Columns:** Product Variant (A, B, C), Number of Customers.
- **Use Case:** Perform a chi-square goodness-of-fit test to determine if preferences are evenly distributed.

### 8. Time Series Dataset
- **Description:** Monthly sales data for a product over 3 years.
- **Columns:** Month, Sales (in $).
- **Use Case:** Perform time series analysis and create a trend chart.

### 9. Multiple Regression Dataset
- **Description:** Relationship between sales revenue, advertising spend, and number of sales representatives.
- **Columns:** Advertising Spend (in $), Number of Sales Reps, Sales Revenue (in $).
- **Use Case:** Perform multiple regression analysis to predict sales revenue.

### 10. Design of Experiments (DOE) Dataset
- **Description:** Factorial experiment testing the effect of temperature and pressure on product strength.
- **Columns:** Temperature (Low, High), Pressure (Low, High), Product Strength (in MPa).
- **Use Case:** Perform factorial ANOVA to analyze the effects of temperature and pressure.
